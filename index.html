            Bawz PH was founded in <strong>2019</strong> by a group of
            individuals united by the same raw style and vision, led by
            <span class="ae-about">Aennon Tabungar</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            What started as a small collective has grown into a powerful
            movement. Today, Directed by Aennon Tabungar, Bawz is home to
            <strong>80+ dancers</strong>, each bringing their own flavor, story,
            and energy—yet moving as one.
